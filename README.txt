A very simple Python program to prank your friends and test.
The program, when run, will continue to play the noise.mp3 sound and set the volume to maximum.

Use the pyinstaller command (pyinstaller --onefile pnoise.py --noconsole) to create an EXE file if desired.

NOTE: This has only been tested to work on Windows
